                Birds have different sizes and can be as small as 2 inches and as big as 2.75 metres. For instance, bee
                hummingbird (smallest) and ostrich (largest). Birdâ€™s existence dates back to 160 million years ago.

                There are different types of birds that exist which vary in characteristics. For instance, there are
                penguins that cannot fly. Further, there are birds that are known for their intelligence like Parrots
                and Corvidae.

                Moreover, we have peacocks which are beautiful and symbolize rain and good weather. Next, there are bats
                and vultures as well. Birds connect very closely to the environment and are quite intuitive.

                They can predict the weather conditions and some are kept near coal mines for the prediction of a mine
                explosion. It is because they are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide. They are
                quite social and enjoy singing as well. Birds enjoy the freedom of moving anywhere without boundaries.

                irst of all, all kinds of living organisms which are eukaryotes and compose of numerous cells and can
                sexually reproduce are known as animals. All animals have a unique role to play in maintaining the
                balance of nature.

                A lot of animal species exist in both, land and water. As a result, each of them has a purpose for their
                existence. The animals divide into specific groups in biology. Amphibians are those which can live on
                both, land and water.

                Reptiles are cold-blooded animals which have scales on their body. Further, mammals are ones which give
                birth to their offspring in the womb and have mammary glands. Birds are animals whose forelimbs evolve
                into wings and their body is covered with feather.

                They lay eggs to give birth. Fishes have fins and not limbs. They breathe through gills in water.
                Further, insects are mostly six-legged or more. Thus, these are the kinds of animals present on earth.
